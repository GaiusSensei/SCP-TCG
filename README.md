SCP-TCG
=======

Trading Card Game inspired by http://scp-wiki.net :)  

The objective of the game is to contain more Anomalies in the World than other players. The game ends when one of the harder-to-contain Anomalies trigger a game ending scenario, which usually gives a penalty to the player who let it happen. Keep in mind that contained Anomalies still need to be secured, and both the containment and security of the Anomalies use up resources- sometimes permanently. The players must weigh the risks of containing a high value Anomaly (which are hard to secure) versus containing multiple easier to secure Anomalies. Of course, players with the high-risk-high-reward Anomalies may just let the world end just to win..
