SCP-TCG
=======

Trading Card Game inspired by http://scp-wiki.net :)  

The objective of the game is to contain more Anomalies in the World than other players. The game ends when one of the harder-to-contain Anomalies trigger a game ending scenario, which usually gives a penalty to the player who let it happen. Keep in mind that contained Anomalies still need to be secured, and both the containment and security of the Anomalies use up resources- sometimes permanently. The players must weigh the risks of containing a high value Anomaly (which are hard to secure) versus containing multiple easier to secure Anomalies. Of course, players with the high-risk-high-reward Anomalies may just let the world end just to win..

Welcome, Site Director, to the SCP Trading Card Game.

Quick Start: Setup
---
1. Each player shuffle their deck.
2. Decide who goes first.
3. Each player draws 6 cards. 
4. Each player may put up to 6 cards to the bottom of their deck.
5. Each player draws cards equal to the number of cards they put to the bottom of their deck.

This is discussed in detail on the Rulebook's Chapter 2.

Quick Start: Game Proper
---
1. Research Phase: Draw from your deck until you have 6 cards.  
2. Recruit Phase: Activate Personnel cards from your hand.  
3. Requisition Phase: Activate Item cards from your hand, and attach any Item cards in your Site to your Personnel cards.   
4. Recon Phase: Put any number of Anomaly or Event cards face-down to the shared Undiscovered Anomalies pile.  
5. **If it's the first round, skip the phases below and pass the turn to the player to your left.**  
6. Secure Anomalies Phase: Remove one counter of every kind on all the cards in the shared World zone, then reveal a random card on the shared Undiscovered Anomalies pile. You may now assign personnel to secure any cards on your Site or on the shared World zone.   
7. Contain Anomalies Phase: Check if any Anomalies have triggered any 'Unsecured' or 'Uncontained' keywords. Afterwards, if the total value of cards securing an Anomaly card exceeds that card's value, then put the Anomaly card to your's Site.  
8. Protect Site Phase: Return all of your Personnel and Item cards back to your Site.  
9. Pass the turn to the player to your left.  

This is discussed in detail on the Rulebook's Chapter 3.
