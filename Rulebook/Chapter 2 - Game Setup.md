Chapter 2 - Game Setup

Game Setup
---
The SCP Trading Card Game can be played by two or more players. Each player needs a valid SCPTCG Deck (see Chapter 1) in order to play. Before beginning a game, clearly state the positions of the zones (especially the shared zones) to each player.   
1. Each player should randomize their decks.  
2. Each player should decide who goes first; and the turn order will start from that player clockwise.  
3. Each player should put their deck into their own Resource zones, and draw 6 cards.  
4. Each player may deactivate up to six (6) cards in their hand and draw the same amount. Each player may only do this once.  
5. When all players have settled on their starting hand, the first player may now begin the game.  

How to Win
---
1. When all other players have lost the game, the remaining player have won the game.   
2. After the game ends, any player that has the most Victory Points wins the game.

How to Lose
---
1. Any player may concede at any time.  
2. When a rule or effect instructs a player to draw a card from their Resource zone, and there are zero cards to draw, then that player has lost the game.  
3. After the game ends, any player that does not have the most Victory Points loses the game.  
4. If more than one player wins the game, those players lose the game.  

Golden Rules
---
1. Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time.  
2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can't happen, the "can't" effect takes precedence.  
3. When a rule or effect is impossible to perform, it is ignored.
