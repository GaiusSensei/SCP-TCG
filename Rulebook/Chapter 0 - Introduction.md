Welcome to the SCP Trading Card Game
===
You are a newly minted Site Director of the SCP Foundation. Your task is to contain as many Anomalies as possible before a K-Class Scenario occurs- and believe me, it WILL occur.

Objective
---
The objective of this game is to gain more victory points than every other player when the game ends. The easiest way to gain victory points is to contain anomalies, but some card effects can also give you victory points (or penalties).
