Common Tags
---
The following tags are used in all of the cardsets of the SCP Trading Card Game. They have no effects of their own, but other rules & effects may refer to them.
- **Anomaly**  
Cards with the Anomaly tag are used on the *Recon Phase* and are discovered randomly during the *Secure Anomalies Phase*, and they usually have an *Anomaly Level* and *Uncontained* effect. Cards with this tag are contained and secured in order to gain victory points.
- **Keter**  
Cards with the Keter tag usually have an *Anomaly Level* of 6 or higher, an *Uncontained* effect that has a game-ending effect such as the *K-Class "Site Shutdown" Scenario*, as well as an *Unsecured* effect that brings the card back to the world if not properly secured. These cards have high victory point values.
- **Euclid**  
Cards with the Euclid tag usually have an *Anomaly Level* of 4 or higher, an *Uncontained* effect that affects all players, as well as an *Unsecured* effect that brings the card back to the world if not properly secured. These cards have moderate victory point values.
- **Safe**  
Cards with the Safe tag usually have an *Anomaly Level* of 2 and an *Uncontained* effect that removes itself from the game. These cards have low victory point values.
- **Personnel**    
Cards with the Personnel tag are activated on the *Recruitment Phase* and are used to secure Anomalies during the *Secure Anomalies*. 
- **Item**  
Cards with the Item tag are activated on the *Requisition Phase* and are used to amplify card with the Personnel tag.
- **Specialist**  
Cards with the Specialist tag usually have a Personnel tag also.
- **Operation**  
Cards with the Operation tag usually have an *Opportunity* effect that dictates when the card can be used. Operation cards are usually one-shot effects that are either deactivated or neutralized after resolution.
- **Event**  
Cards with the Event tag are used on the *Recon Phase* and are discovered randomly during the *Secure Anomalies Phase*. Event cards are usually one-shot effects that are either deactivated or neutralized after resolution.

Simultaneous Effects
---
If anything happens simultaneously, such as multiple triggers on the same condition, or multiple players activating an Operation card in the same time, the effects & cards will always resolve in the order below:
1. The active player will decide the order of cards/effects that they control would resolve.
2. The next player in turn order will decide next, then the next player, until all simultaneous effects are in order.

This means that the current active player will always resolve effects and triggers first, and each player can decide the order of resolution of simultaneous triggers.
