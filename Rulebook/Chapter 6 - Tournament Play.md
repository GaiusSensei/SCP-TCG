Chapter 6 - Tournament Play
===
In order to play the SCP Trading Card Game competatively, the organizer of the tournament must prepare at least the Foundation League rules and have a complete decklists of every player in that league. The Premier (Keter, Euclid and Safe) Leagues all refer to the decklist data gathered during the Foundation League, and the more games in Foundation League, the better balanced the other three leagues are going to be.  

When a card is Banned (or Restricted), then the card cannot be used in decklists when entering a tournament in the league. If there are no other cards that can be used in a particular slot (eg. All Queen of Hearts cards have been Banned or Restricted), then a card from the Redacted cardset may be used. None of the cards in the Redacted cardset may be banned or restricted, and are never included when gauging the metagame on the Foundation League.  

Foundation League

Banned: None  
In this league, the metagame is measured by recording the decklists of every player who joined the tournament. It is recommended to play more than one tournement over multiple days so that the players can measure which cards are overpowered and are a 'must-include' over other less powerful cards.

Premier Leagues
---
**Premier Keter League**  
Banned: The Top 5% of the Foundation League Metagame cannot be used.   
**Premier Euclid League**  
Banned: The Top 25% of the Foundation League Metagame cannot be used.  
**Premier Safe League**  
Banned: The Top 50% of the Foundation League Metagame cannot be used.  

Special Restrictions

If any of the premier leagues are still unbalanced due to the presence of overpowered cards (defined below), then the tournament organizer may make some cards 'Restricted', which means that a particular card cannot be used on a specific league. Overpowered Cards are defined as cards which is a 'must-include' or the player will have a hard time winning the tournament.
